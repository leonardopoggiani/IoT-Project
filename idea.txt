14. Liquid Level Monitoring System

This IoT-based project involves building a liquid level monitoring system that can
 remotely monitor a particular liquid’s level and prevent it from overflowing.
 This project holds immense value for the industrial sector that uses large volumes of fluids in their day-to-day operations. 
Apart from detecting a liquid’s level, this monitoring system can also be used to track the usage of 
specific chemicals and to detect leaks in pipelines. 

The system is fitted with ultrasonic, conductive, and float sensors. 
A WiFi module helps connect the system with the Internet and facilitates data transmission. 
Four ultrasonic sensors help transmit the data on the liquid level and alert the user on the same.
